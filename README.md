# Self-Driving Car Simulation Without Libraries

![Demo](demo.png) <!-- Replace demo.png with your screenshot of the simulation -->

This is a **self-driving car simulation** implemented purely in **JavaScript**, HTML, and CSS ‚Äî **no external libraries** are used. The project demonstrates AI-controlled cars navigating a road while avoiding obstacles and following lanes using simple neural networks.

## üöó Features

- AI-controlled cars using neural networks
- Sensor-based collision detection
- Multiple lanes and realistic road simulation
- Traffic (dummy cars) for AI cars to avoid
- Real-time visualization of the neural network
- Gradient and styling improvements for a better UI

## üß© Simulation Details

- **Cars:**
  - AI cars (blue) are controlled by neural networks.
  - Dummy cars (red) move along lanes as obstacles.
  - Each car has a sensor system to detect road borders and other cars.
- **Road:**
  - Divided into 3 lanes (default), with dashed lane markers.
  - Styled to resemble a real road with gradient effect.
- **Network Visualization:**
  - Displays neural network of the best car in real-time.
  - Gradient lines for a more appealing look.

## üõ† How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samprit74/self-driven-car-simulation-without-library.git
Open index.html in a web browser (Chrome recommended).

Use the save üíæ and discard üóëÔ∏è buttons to manage the best AI car brain.

Watch AI-controlled cars learn to navigate the road in real-time!

‚öôÔ∏è Libraries

No external libraries are used.

Pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Neural networks and visualization are implemented manually in network.js and visualizer.js.

üåü Future Improvements

Train AI with different neural network architectures.

Add more dynamic obstacles and road layouts.

Add stats dashboard for AI performance.
